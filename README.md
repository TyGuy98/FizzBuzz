# FizzBuzz
Simple FizzBuzz program I made to get used to using functions, conditional statements and updating the HTML elements.

Skills I learnt:

- Taking input from a user and using it to calculate and update the program
- Using a function to calculate the logic and print the results with specific colour and into the 3 boxes
- Do while loop to check if the input is valid, otherwise keep prompting the user.
- Function to reset the global variables 
- How to connect our script to our html (like using the button to reset our program or output the numbers witht correct colour)

The program could look a lot nicer, but I really wanted to focus on the core concepts. This goes a little beyond the OdinProject course, but I learn best by just adding onto existing programs.
